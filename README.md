Strings
Lab 5: Strings

This lab must be completed by pairs of students. Submissions by individual students will not be accepted under normal circumstances. The intent is that the two students work together.
In this lab you will practice the use of strings. The purpose of the main is to read input from the user and process it using the functions explained below.

isAlpha function 
This function will take a string as parameter and return true only if all the indexes in the stings are alphabets. It will return false otherwise.

isNumeric function 
This function will take a string as parameter and return true only if it could be converted to double. It will return false otherwise.

hasSymbols function 
This function will take a string as parameter and return true if it includes special characters in it. It will return false otherwise. It would be a good idea to use isAlpha and isNumeric to help you with this function. Examples on special chars: @#$%!*( etc.…

displayType function 
This function will take a string as parameter and display a message to the user indicating whether the string is numeric, alphabets or has special symbols. Make sure to use your previous functions to help you with this.

confirmQuit function 
This function will ask the user if they want to quit. It will only accept ‘Y’, ‘y’, ‘N’ or ‘n’ as user response. If the user enters anything else, it will generate an error message and keep prompting until it reads a valid response. It will then return the user response.



Program Specifications
Your main must be able to perform the following requirements:
-	Read an input from the user as a string
-	Use the displayType function to print a message to the user.
-	Ask the user if they want to quit by using confirmQuit function.
-	Keep repeating the previous steps until the user decides to quit.

General Requirements 
-	Include an opening comment with your name, the name of the program, the date, and a short description. 
-	Follow the style guide! Use descriptive names and sensible datatypes for variables, constants, arrays, functions, etc. that follow our naming conventions. Use good spacing and make sure braces ({}) are located where they are supposed to be. 
-	Output messages must be meaningful. Displaying values is not enough, the user must understand what he is seeing. 
-	Create a 3-to-5-minute video in which you demo running your code, testing it with different values/scenarios and explaining the code included. You will need 2 videos. One video for each group member. Make sure to state your name and id at the beginning of the video.

Submission
-	Make sure to submit your work on DC Connect before due date
-	Submit your .h , .cpp files and the video you created as separate files, no zip files please.
-	Up to -30% deduction if you decide to submit a zip or compressed file
-	 Grades will be granted according to class coding guidelines, professionalism, output clarity and solution ingenuity.
